        <h1>ABOUT BUG TRACKING SYSTEM</h1>



        <h5> A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track
            of
            reported software
            bugs
            in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.
            Many bug
            tracking
            systems,
            such as those used by most open source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug
            reports
            directly Other
            systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development.
            Typically
            bug tracking
            systems are integrated with other software project management applications. A bug tracking
            system is
            usually a
            necessary component of a good software development infrastructure, and consistent use of a
            bug or
            issue tracking
            system is considered one  of a good software team.<br> <br>
            A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known
            bugs. Facts
            may include
            the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on
            how to
            reproduce the
            bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be
            working on
            fixing it.


            
            Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is
            tracked
            through the status
            assigned to the bug.
             <!-- A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure
            permissions
            based on status,
            move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow
            administrators to
            configure the
            bug statuses and to what extent a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will
            e-mail
            interested
            parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the
            status
            changes.
